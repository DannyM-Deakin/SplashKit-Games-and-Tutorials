# SplashKit Games and Tutorials
 
## Overview
Our project is building a software for Multi-Game Arcade Machine, allowing users to select a game from a local library of games. This software will be cross platform compatible, so we can run it on different machines. 
In this trimester, we focus on completing the arcade machine software. The team is currently reviewing and fixing the bugs in existing source code. In this trimester we will try to install the software on the machine.
